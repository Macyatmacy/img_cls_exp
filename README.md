# Medical Image Classification Proj. 

Hello!

This is a repo for a workshop on applied computer vision. We aims at develop an mobile app that can help medical diagnose at first. And we further develops a machine learning workflow that can update model and return prediction outcomes automatically, through our first CI/CD demo based on AWS platform and Github.


## Platforms and tools.

- Google Colab Notebook.

- Github.

- AWS Sagemaker.

- TFlite.

## Datasets:

We use two datasets from [kaggle](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/2), the ChestXray2017 dataset and OCT2017 dataset, regarding diagnose of pneumonia and common treatable blinding retinal diseases respetively.

The ChestXray2017 includes three classes: normal, bacterial pneumonia and viral pneumonia, as shown in the figure below.
